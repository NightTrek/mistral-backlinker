# Lead Extractor and Contact Info Finder

## Overview


This Python script is part of our lead generation toolkit designed to scrape contact information (phone numbers and emails) from websites listed in a CSV file. Our toolkit utilizes Selenium WebDriver for browsing and web page scraping, but it has been expanded with additional capabilities.

Now, this set of tools includes the following components:

1. Scraper: A script that uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate websites and extract required contact information.
2. Parser (Mistral): Our parser processes website HTML using Mistral and produces structured JSON objects for each lead.
3. Research Agents: A set of agents that research each lead, gathering additional information about their industry, company size, and potential needs.
4. Pitch Advisors: Agents that advise on the best way to pitch our Backlinker product based on the gathered data.
5. Email Writers: Agents that use the researched info and sales advice to write personalized emails as the CEO of Backlinker.

We're constantly improving our tools, so stay tuned for more updates!

The script is efficient in filtering out irrelevant links and focuses on extracting valuable leads and contact information, making it a powerful tool for digital marketing and sales prospecting.
